# Restrict interfaces so that only members of the same kind of are allowed in them (no-mixed-interface)

This rule enforces that an inteface only has one type of members, eg. only data properties or only functions.

## Rule Details

Mixing functions and data properties in the same interface is a sign of object-orientation style.

## Options

The rule does not accept any options.
